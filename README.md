LightController
---------------

12 HTML5 input-fields that sends ajax calls on change.
On load it asks the server for the current values and changes the sliders.

NO DESIGN DONE.
NO SECURITY WHATSOEVER.


Server should have the following API:

# get_lights [GET]:

Return the current values of all the lights.
JSON format should be:

{
	"lights": {
		"1": VALUE,
		"2": VALUE,
		"ID": VALUE,
		...
	}
}

Where VALUE is 0-100 (int) and ID (int) is the code for a specific light.

# set_light [GET]:

Set light value for specific light.
Parameters:
{ light: ID, value: VALUE }
where ID is 1-12 and VALUE is 1-100

Or:

{ "all": VALUE }

Turn on/off all lights at the same time.

where VALUE is either "on" or "off"

Stylesheets, images, fonts, and javascript files go in the `/source/assets/` directory.

The source folders for images and fonts have a `.keep` file in them so they can be in the repo, but you can remove those files.
